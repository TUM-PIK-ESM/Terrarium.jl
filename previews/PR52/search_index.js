All models must be defined as structs that subtype AbstractModel and will typically consist of the following fields/properties:\n\nA grid that defines the discretization of the spatial domain\nAn initializer responsible for initializing state variables\nOne or more processes and/or sub-models that define the state variables and the dynamics of the system\n\nThe distinction between what constitutes a “model” versus a “process” should be based on whether or not there is a use case for running simulations of that model/process independently from other processes. Models should be built to be independently runnable standalone in a Simulation, while process types simply provide the concrete implementations of the physical processes to be included in a model. Since Terrarium models are composable, it should generally be trivial to convert a process into a full standalone model later (if necessary) without affecting the other model components that depend on it.\n\nAll AbstractModel and AbstractProcess types must additional provide dispatches for the following methods:\n\nvariables(::Model) returns a tuple of variable metadata declaring the state variables. Variables must be one of two types: prognostic or auxiliary (sometimes referred to as “diagnostic”). Prognostic variables fully characterize the state of the system at any given timestep and are updated according to their tendencies (i.e. G in the aforementioned equation). Tendencies are automatically allocated for each prognostic variable declared by the model.\ncompute_auxiliary!(state, ::Model) computes the values of all auxiliary variables (if necessary) assuming that the prognostic variables of the system in state are available for the current timestep.\ncompute_tendencies!(state, ::Model) computes the tendencies based on the current values of the prognostic and auxiliary variables stored in state.\n\nIn addition, AbstractModel  implementations must also provide dispatches for the following methods:\n\ninitialize!(state, ::Model, ::Initializer) computes any necessary initialization of the model state based on the user-supplied configuration and parameter settings. The additional initializer argument is extracted from the model and allows for alternative dispatches based on various initialization schemes for each model.\ntimestep!(state, ::Model, ::TimeStepper, Δt) updates the prognostic state variables according to the given timestepping scheme. This method can and should be implemented generically for any timestepping scheme but allows for model-specific overrides where necessary.\nget_grid(::Model) returns the spatial grid associated with the model. A default implementation is provided which assumes that the model defines a field named grid.\nget_initializer(::Model) returns the initializer for the model. A default implementation is provided which assumes that the model defines a field named initializer.","category":"section"},{"location":"overview/software_architecture/#State-variables","page":"Software architecture","title":"State variables","text":"State variables are realized as Oceananigans Fields defined over the model grid. Each variable returned by the variables method will be allocated a corresponding Field with boundary conditions and initial values specified by one or more AbstractInitializers defined on the model. This allocation occurs when creating a Simulation by calling  initialize(model). The resulting Simulation object will have a property state of type StateVariables which holds all of the Fields for each state variable defined by the model.\n\nAs an example, suppose we are implementing a new model MyModel and we want to define the necessary state variables. We do this by defining a new dispatch of the variables method:\n\nvariables(::MyModel) = (\n\tprognostic(:progvar, XYZ()),\n\tauxiliary(:auxvar, XYZ()),\n\tauxiliary(:bc, XY()),\n)\n\nThis will result in a total of four state variables being allocated when initialize(model) is called: two auxiliary variables named auxvar and bc as well as one prognostic variable named progvar along with its corresponding tendency which is created automatically. The second argument to the variable metadata constructors prognostic and auxiliary is a subtype of VarDims which specifies on which spatial dimensions the state variable should be defined. XYZ() corresponds to a 3D Field which is discretized both laterally (along spatial grid cells) and along the vertical axis. Currently, Terrarium only supports a single 3D grid representing variables defined in the soil domain, though this may change in the near future in order to accommodate multi-layer snow and canopy processes. XY() corresponds to a 2D field which is discretized along the lateral dimension only. Note that Terrarium also currently supports only 1D (vertical) dynamics so all grid cells on the X and Y axes will be assumed independent. This is equivalent to what is typically called a single column model, or column-based parameterization in atmosphere and ocean modeling. However, building on Oceananigans means that we have a clear path to relax this assumption in the future!","category":"section"},{"location":"physics/soil_energy_water/#Soil-hydrothermal-dynamics","page":"Energy and water balance","title":"Soil hydrothermal dynamics","text":"warning: Warning\nThis page is a work in progress.

If both the upper and lower boundaries are assumed to be constant over time, the steady-state temperature profile takes the form of a continuous piecewise linear function increasing over depth with the slope determined by the thermal properties of the ground material. The instantaneous temperature field can then be generally represented as\n\nbeginequation\nT(zt) = T_0 + fracQ_textgeokappa_texth(z)z + Delta T(zt)\nendequation\n\nwhere T(zt) is the temperature field (K) over depth z (m) and time t (s), T_0 is the mean annual GST (K), Q_textgeo is the geothermal heat flux (W/m²), and kappa_texth(z) (W/m K) is the thermal conductivity which may vary with depth depending on the material. The last term Delta T(zt) represents transient disturbances to the steady state temperature profile due to both seasonal and long-term fluctuations in the upper and lower boundary conditions of the vertical domain. Simulating the impacts of these transient changes is one of the primary objectives of most numerical permafrost and land surface models.\n\nDiffusive heat flow in a solid medium is governed by Fourier's law,\n\nbeginequation\n    mathbfj_texth cdot mathbfn_z = -kappa_texthfracpartial Tpartial z\nendequation\n\nwhere mathbfj_texth (W/m²) is the diffusive heat flux vector and mathbfn_z is the upward facing normal vector along the vertical z axis.\n\nSince ground materials are often porous, i.e., there exists void space between the solid particles, it is necessary to consider the potential presence of water and/or ice in this void space, which is hereafter referred to as pore space, or simply, soil pores. The thermal effects of water and ice can be accounted for by considering not only the temperature of the material but rather the total internal energy of the elementary volume. Combining the diffusive flux with a potential advective heat flux j_z^textw due to water flow yields the energy conservation law,\n\nbeginequation\nfracpartial U(Ttheta)partial t - nabla cdot left(mathbfj_texth + mathbfj_h^textwright) - F_h(zt) = 0\nendequation\n\nwhere U(Ttheta) (J/m³) is the volumetric internal energy as a function of temperature and total water/ice content theta (m³/m³), and F_h(zt) is an inhomogeneous heat source/sink (forcing) term.\n\nThe advective heat flux j_texth^textw can be represented as,\n\nbeginequation\nmathbfj_texth^textw = left( c_textw T + L_textsl right) mathbfj_textw rho_textw\nendequation\n\nwhere L_textsl and c_textw (J/kg) represent the specific latent heat of fusion and heat capacity of liquid water respectively. This flux term accounts for the energy transferred by the movement of water within the soil matrix. In model configurations that neglect subsurface water flow, this flux term is implicitly assumed to be zero.","category":"section"},{"location":"physics/soil_energy_water/#Energy-temperature-closure","page":"Energy and water balance","title":"Energy-temperature closure","text":"The constitutive relationship between energy and temperature plays a key role in characterizing the subsurface energy balance.

This means that all physical processes in the model must be written as terms in a set of continuous-time equations of the form:\n\nfracpartial u(xt)partial t = G(u(xt)) + F(xt)\n\nwhere u(xt) is a field describing the prognostic state of the system, t is time, F is a focing term, and G is a (differentiable) function which computes the tendencies, i.e. the change in the prognostic state at the current time, t.\n\nIn many areas of science and engineering, this approach to modeling is fairly standard. It can be contrasted, however, with discrete-time dynamical modeling where state changes are computed according to a series of discrete update rules, mathbfD, with some fixed time resolution,\n\nmathbfu_t+1 = mathbfD(mathbfu_t)\n\nThe continuous-time formulation has three key advantages over the discrete approach:\n\nFaithfulness to realistic physical processes. Within the context of Earth system modeling, we are primarily interested in processes that operate continuously in time, not in discrete steps. Although the physics of land models may lack a well-defined “dynamical core” of fluid dynamics like those found in atmosphere and ocean models, they are still ultimately centered around hydrological, thermodynamic, and biological processes that have continuous-time dynamics. As such, we believe that it is generally preferable to build models that follow this structure.\nFlexibility in timestepping and error control. Discrete-time formulations of dynamical systems necessarily require strong assumptions about the time-discretization of the system which often amount to a form of forward Euler with a fixed timestep size. Re-adjustment of the timestep size in mathbfD is sometimes achieved by rescaling rate parameters. However, this rescaling makes the strong assumption that the dynamics of the system scale linearly with the timescale and ignores potential feedback mechanisms and scale-dependent interactions in the dynamics. Continuous-time formulations relax this assumption and permit a much broader range of timestepping strategies that can account for nonlinearity and are thus, in our view, better suited to the simulation of coupled physical processes.\nHeterogeneous temporal resolution. Data assimilation and parameter estimation problems often necessitate the comparison of model outputs with observational time series data. These data often come at differing temporal resolutions and have irregular sample spacing due to, e.g. missing values. This can pose a problem for discrete-time models which must either (i) rescale the timestep to match the data, which has significant physical implications, or (ii) resort to temporal interpolation of the model outputs which is likely to violate the underlying physical conservation laws. Continuous-time systems do not have this problem since the timestep can always be adapted to obtain output at any set of time points.\n\nNote that one common problem in continuous-time dynamical modeling is the representation of discontinuous or instantaneous events/disruptions to the system. Such events can, however,  be handled through the use of callback functions based on the (discretized) state mathbfu. These cases should nonetheless be considered the exception rather than the rule.","category":"section"},{"location":"overview/mathematical_formulation/#Practical-implications","page":"Mathematical formulation","title":"Practical implications","text":"While the above modeling philosophy has many advantages, it also places some practical restrictions on how we code the model physics. The most important constraints are:\n\nPrognostic (i.e. time-integrated) state variables must be clearly and coherently distinguished from all other auxiliary variables derived from the prognostic state.\nPrognostic variables of the system should only be updated by the timestepper (or callback) and should not be otherwise modified by the physical processes within a single timestep. Note that this effectively rules out all classical “bucket schemes” for soil hydrology which rely on non-physical, instantaneous routing of water between soil layers.\nFor physical coherence, tendencies must be computed only based on the current state of the system. Similarly, all non-prognostic (auxiliary) variables should be derived only from the prognostic state and/or forcings; they should not depend on non-prognostic values from previous timesteps, except in special cases where previous values are used only for computational efficiency (e.g. iterative solvers).\n\nThese restrictions can potentially be relaxed in some cases through the use of callbacks and/or nested time-stepping schemes, but the goal should always be to adhere to them as much as possible to avoid unncessary complexity.","category":"section"},{"location":"physics/vegetation/#Vegetation","page":"Vegetation","title":"Vegetation","text":"warning: Warning\nThis page is a work in progress.

We write unit tests for every function of our model. In some cases this might appear trivial, but we still want to achieve a near complete coverage of our code in the tests. The majority of the tests should cover the smallest possible units over different input arguments and types (if applicable). Unit tests should typically call the tested functions in a way that is representative for their use in the model, but try to reduce the computational complexity (e.g. by choosing very low dimensional inputs) to keep the overall CI time manageable. Additionally, we have some tests that ensure top-level functionality and stability of the model as well. Every additional proposed feature in a Pull Request has to come with unit tests.

This means that most computations need to be implemented within kernel functions that follow KernelAbstractions’ syntax. Each thread in the CPU or GPU will then compute the discretized equations for a single grid point.\n\nFor writing kernels we follow a strategy closely inspired by Oceaninanigans.jl: we want to fuse kernels as much as possible. Kernel fusion means that in practice we write very “large” kernels that fuse as many operations as possible together in one kernel. Kernel fusion leads to more efficient GPU computations, especially by reducing memory demand (Wang et. al 2000). In order to still keep our code well structured and modular, our approach relies on implementing most processes as inlined functions that can be called from a GPU kernel. We have not yet found any significant limitations to this approach.\n\nHow this looks in action in Terrarium.jl you can already see in the prototype code, e.g. for the SoilEnergyBalance: There compute_tendencies! is the mandatory function for the model component, it launches exactly one kernel compute_energy_tendency!, which includes several @inline function to compute individual contributions to the energy balance such as energy_tendency, thermalconductivity and the diffusive_heat_flux.\n\nIt's also worth checking out the Simulation tips provided in the documentation for Oceananigans.","category":"section"},{"location":"contributing/#Automatic-Differentiation-with-Enzyme","page":"Contributing","title":"Automatic Differentiation with Enzyme","text":"For AD, we rely primarily on reverse mode differentiation via Enzyme.jl. In contrast to many other AD systems, Enzyme doesn’t put particularly strong restrictions on coding style. For example, Array mutations are not only allowed, they are even encouraged!\n\nThere is one thing however, that is crucial for Enzyme to work: type stability. The code absolutely has to be type stable, even in parts that are performance non-critical. Every occurrence of type instability may break differentiability with Enzyme. If this happens, we recommend first quickly checking for type instability of core function calls using @code_warntype and @inferred in unit tests. Then, if the issue is not yet apparent, debug the code using Cthulhu.jl. Cthulhu is an awesome tool to interactively inspect your code for type instabilities and it is extremely easy to run: just preempt the function that you are trying to differentiate with @descend after loading the Cthulhu package.\n\nEnzyme does, however, have some disadvantages; it is still not fully mature and bugs do occur. As of the time of writing (August 2025), this is especially the case for Julia 1.11. We currently recommend staying on Julia 1.10.10 (LTS) for the time being. Other cryptic Enzyme error messages have become rarer with time, but they do still occasionally happen. In these cases, we, along with our AD team led by Valentin in the DELTA-ESM project, are happy to offer support to the best of our abilities.","category":"section"},{"location":"notebooks/example_model_notebook/","page":"Model Interface","title":"Model Interface","text":"<style>\n    #documenter-page table {\n        display: table !important;\n        margin: 2rem auto !important;\n        border-top: 2pt solid rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\n        border-bottom: 2pt solid rgba(0,0,0,0.2);\n    }\n\n    #documenter-page pre, #documenter-page div {\n        margin-top: 1.4rem !important;\n        margin-bottom: 1.4rem !important;\n    }\n\n    .code-output {\n        padding: 0.7rem 0.5rem !important;\n    }\n\n    .admonition-body {\n        padding: 0em 1.25em !important;\n    }\n</style>\n\n<!-- PlutoStaticHTML.Begin -->\n<!--\n    # This information is used for caching.\n    [PlutoStaticHTML.State]\n    input_sha = \"ab8df2c56927ae5945c8e0d5e580e62109ad4368745f323e697b3d3b7765cdbd\"\n    julia_version = \"1.11.8\"\n-->\n\n<div class=\"markdown\"><h1 id=\"A-super-basic-example-model-with-Terrarium\">A super basic example model with Terrarium</h1><p>In this example we will set up an embarrassingly simple example to demonstrate Terrarium's model interface.
