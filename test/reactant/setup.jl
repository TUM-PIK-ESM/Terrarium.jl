# skin-temperature solve, bare-ground evaporation, surface runoff/infiltration, and the snow↔soil
# coupling (blended soil-top heat flux, meltwater outflow, sublimation).
#
# Cold winter conditions: a frozen, unsaturated soil column under a shallow snowpack. The pack is
# kept below freezing (air temperature < 0) so the 100-step comparison does not hinge on the exact
