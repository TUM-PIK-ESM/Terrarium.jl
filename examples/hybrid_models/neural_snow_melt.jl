# # Hybrid modeling: a neural-network snow melt trained with Reactant + Enzyme
#
# This example is a **technical demonstration** of *hybrid* (physics + machine-learning) modeling
# in Terrarium: we take the degree-day snow model from the [snow example](@ref snow_ddm_example)
# and replace its analytic melt law with a small neural network, which we train to reproduce the
# original melt using [Reactant.jl](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Reactant.jl) (compilation) and
# [Enzyme.jl](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme.jl) (reverse-mode gradients). It is deliberately
# a toy problem - the NN just relearns a function we already know - but it shows the full
# machinery: generating training data from a Terrarium process, training an MLP with Reactant +
# Enzyme, and evaluating that MLP *inside a kernel* as a drop-in replacement process.
#
# ## What we are (and are not) doing
#
# * The degree-day melt is `M(T) = max(0, k·(T − T_melt))` — a rectified linear function of
#   temperature. A tiny MLP can represent it. We first train the MLP offline on `(T, M(T))` pairs,
#.  and then continue the training online within a Terrarium model later.
# * The `NeuralSnowMelt` process evaluates the trained MLP **per grid point inside a
#   KernelAbstractions kernel**. Plain `Lux.apply` cannot be compiled inside a kernel, so we use
#   [KernelLux.jl](https://github.com/maximilian-gelbrecht/KernelLux.jl), whose `apply_in_kernel`
#   is a device-safe drop-in for `Lux.apply` for a `Chain` of `Dense` layers.

# vectorized array operation. This traces natively under Reactant (no `raise` needed for it — it is
# plain array math, exactly Reactant's normal Lux workflow) and differentiates with Enzyme the
# same way the offline training does. For a large network the batched matmul is far more efficient
# than a per-point kernel; the trade-off is that the tendency is computed for the whole grid at

# ## Online fine-tuning: training *through* the full Terrarium model
#
# The training above was *offline*: we fit the melt law `M(T)` pointwise, independently of the
# simulation. *Online* training instead differentiates through the model's own time integration.
# Here we do this with the full `SnowModel`, which contains the neural network,
# stepped by `run_timesteps!` — on the Reactant device: we roll the model forward, compare the
# simulated snow to a reference trajectory, and let Enzyme backpropagate through the compiled
# rollout to the network weights. This is the differentiable-simulation idea, and it is what
# Reactant + Enzyme make possible.
#
# It can help even in this toy setting: the offline objective fits `M(T)` pointwise, whereas the
# online objective matches the simulated snow trajectory directly — the quantity we care about —
# so a small pointwise melt error that would accumulate over the rollout gets corrected.
#
# ### Two ways to evaluate the network — same result
#
# We run the online fine-tuning **twice**, with the two processes defined above, to show to both them
# as they both have possible applicaations for hybrid land modelling with Terrarium.
#
# 1. **In-kernel** (`NeuralSnowMelt`): the network is evaluated per grid point inside a
#    KernelAbstractions kernel (`apply_in_kernel`). This composes naturally with per-point,
#    kernel-based physics, but for a large network the per-point evaluation is comparatively slow.
# 2. **Batched, kernel-free** (`NeuralSnowMeltBatched`): the network is evaluated for all columns
#    at once with a single batched `Lux.apply` and no kernel launch. For a large network this
#    batched matmul is far more efficient, but the tendency is a whole-grid vectorized operation
#    that does not fold into a per-point physics kernel.
#
# Both are differentiated through the identical `run_timesteps!` rollout and, starting from the
# same offline weights, converge to essentially the same finetuned model.
