# # Differentiating Terrarium.jl with Reactant
#
# The [differentiation example](@ref) shows how to take gradients of Terrarium simulations with
# [Enzyme.jl](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme.jl) on the CPU, using
# [Checkpointing.jl](https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/Checkpointing.jl) to keep the
# reverse pass memory-bounded. Here we do the same thing through
# [Reactant.jl](https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Reactant.jl): the whole gradient computation is traced
# to MLIR/StableHLO and compiled with XLA, and checkpointing is expressed directly with Reactant's
# `@trace checkpointing=true` loop instead of Checkpointing.jl.
#
# As everywhere with Reactant in Terrarium, the only change to the model itself is the
# architecture: we build the grid on `ReactantState()`.

# spacing (see the [Reactant page](@ref)).

integrator = initialize(model; boundary_conditions = bcs, initializers)

# We differentiate a scalar objective — the mean-square soil temperature after `nsteps` — with
# respect to the initial state. The time loop calls the raw per-step functions (`timestep!` with
# the model's timestepper, then `compute_auxiliary!`) rather than `run!`, because `run!` itself
# compiles and we want to compile the *whole* gradient in one go. [`run_timesteps!`](@ref) is the
# stepping loop underlying `run!`; on `ReactantState` it traces the loop and takes a `checkpointing`
# scheme. Passing `Reactant.Periodic(n)` stores `n` checkpoints and recomputes the rest during the
# reverse pass, keeping memory bounded for long integrations (the same scheme is accepted by `run!`
# via its `checkpointing` keyword).

# `Enzyme.autodiff` in reverse mode computes the objective together with its gradient. We pass the
# integrator as `Duplicated`, so its shadow `dintegrator` accumulates the sensitivity of the loss
# with respect to every state variable — in particular the initial internal energy `U₀`.
