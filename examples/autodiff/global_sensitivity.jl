# # Global sensitivity analysis with Reactant + Enzyme
#
# This example computes *global sensitivity maps*: Both parameter sensitivty and state sensitivty. 
# We start by computing the sensitivity of the global mean surface
# soil temperature after one simulated day with respect to the initial soil state at **every**
# land grid point and soil layer. Reverse-mode AD delivers this entire map in a *single* gradient
# evaluation — the cost of the reverse pass is independent of the number of inputs, which is what
# makes global (all-points-at-once) sensitivity analysis feasible.
#
# We follow the same Reactant + Enzyme recipe as the
# [Reactant differentiation example](@ref): the model is built on `ReactantState()`, the stepping
# loop [`run_timesteps!`](@ref) is traced with a checkpointing scheme, and `Enzyme.autodiff`
# differentiates through the whole compiled rollout. The physical setup mirrors the ERA5-forced
# global soil heat example (`examples/simulations/soil_heat_global_era5.jl`).

# ## Grid and forcing
#
# We build the same ~1° global land grid as the ERA5 example: all grid points with more than 50%
# land become independent soil columns. Reactant currently requires uniform vertical spacing (see
# the [Reactant page](@ref)), so we use `UniformSpacing` instead of `ExponentialSpacing`.

grid = ColumnRingGrid(ReactantState(), Float32, UniformSpacing(Δz = 0.2f0, N = Nz), land_mask)

# Load ERA-5 2 meter air temperature at ~1° resolution as the surface forcing. The compiled
# stepping loop cannot yet update time-dependent `FieldTimeSeries` inputs from the host, so we
# take the first time slice as a constant-in-time forcing field (a `FieldInputSource`, as in the
# hybrid modeling example).

# The full-year hourly file is large (~1.5 GB, 8760 time steps); load it lazily and materialize
# only the first time slice, which we use as a constant-in-time forcing.

# As everywhere with Reactant in Terrarium, the model construction is standard — only the grid's
# architecture differs. We give the soil a **loam** texture (sand < 1): it is a representative

# bulk conductivity, which the parameter sensitivity below relies on. The same soil is used
# throughout.

# ## Parameter sensitivity: soil mineral thermal conductivity
#
# The maps above are sensitivities to the *initial state*. The **same** reverse pass also carries
# sensitivities to *model parameters* — the shadow `dintegrator.model` accumulates them alongside the
# state gradients, exactly as the neural-network weights are differentiated in the hybrid modeling
# example. Here we compute ``\partial \bar{T} / \partial \kappa_\text{mineral}``, the sensitivity of
# the column-mean soil temperature to the thermal conductivity of the non-quartz (silt/clay) mineral
# grains.
#
# A scalar physical parameter needs one extra step compared with an array input. On a `ReactantState`
# grid the scalars stored in the model are baked into the compiled program as **constants**, so their
# reverse-mode shadow would come back identically zero. To differentiate with respect to
# ``\kappa_\text{mineral}`` we therefore **promote** the soil conductivities to *traced device scalars*
# with `Reactant.to_rarray(...; track_numbers = true)`, so they enter the compiled program as tracked
# inputs. Eager initialization cannot carry a traced scalar through a process struct, so we use a
# *promote-after-init* pattern: initialize with the ordinary (concrete) conductivities, then rebuild
# the integrator around a model whose conductivities are the promoted, traced copy — reusing the
# already-initialized state.
#
# !!! note "Two ingredients make the traced scalar reach the kernel"
#     (1) The soil thermal-property structs are `Adapt`-adaptable, so the promoted scalar is converted
#     to a device value *inside* the tendency kernel instead of remaining a host tracer. (2) The
#     `InverseQuadratic` bulk-conductivity weighting uses the float power `x^(one(x)/2)` rather than
#     `sqrt`, which has no method for a traced device scalar. Both live in `SoilThermalProperties`.

# We differentiate the **column-mean** soil temperature rather than the surface temperature: over one
# day the surface layer is held by the atmospheric boundary condition and is essentially insensitive to
# soil conductivity, whereas the conductivity controls how heat is redistributed through the column.

# ## Grid-point-wise parameter sensitivity: forward-mode AD

# The reverse pass above collapsed the whole soil state into one scalar objective and returned one
# number. Forward-mode AD answers the complementary question in a single pass: how does that *one*
# scalar parameter ``\kappa_\text{mineral}`` perturb the soil temperature at *every* grid point and
# depth? Reverse mode is the efficient choice for many-inputs → one-output (the initial-condition maps
# above); forward mode is efficient for **one-input → many-outputs**, which is exactly a scalar-parameter
# sensitivity *map*. Note that ``\kappa_\text{mineral}`` stays a single scalar — there is **no
# per-column parameter field**; the map is the forward tangent of the output temperature field.
#
# We seed a unit tangent for ``\kappa_\text{mineral}`` into an otherwise-zero shadow integrator
# (`make_zero` gives the all-zero tangent; we set just the `mineral` component to one) and propagate it
# forward through the rollout. `run_timesteps!` mutates the integrator in place, so after the forward
# pass the shadow's temperature field holds ``\partial T / \partial \kappa_\text{mineral}`` at every
# grid point.
