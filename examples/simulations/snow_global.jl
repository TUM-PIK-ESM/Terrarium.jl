# # [Global snowpack with idealized seasonal forcing](@id snow_global)
#
# This example demonstrates the standalone single-layer [`SnowModel`](@ref) run on a global grid,
# accelerated by GPU (if available), driven by *idealized* analytic forcing rather than reanalysis data.
# We integrate for two full annual cycles so the seasonal accumulation and melt of the snowpack is
# visible in both hemispheres.
#
# The forcing is purely illustrative: a latitude- and season-dependent near-surface air temperature, a
# constant precipitation rate that falls as snow wherever the air is below freezing, and an idealized net
# surface heat flux that cools the pack in winter and warms (melts) it in summer. The two hemispheres are
# driven out of phase.
#
# !!! note
#     This script is intended to be run directly (it is not executed during the documentation build, as a
#     two-year global integration is expensive). Magnitudes are chosen for illustration, not realism.
