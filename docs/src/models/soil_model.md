## Overview

[`SoilModel`](@ref) is a model of soil physics that couples the relevant processes governing energy, water, and carbon in natural soils. It is the primary model type for simulating heat conduction, freeze-thaw processes (e.g. permafrost), and variably saturated water flow in the subsurface.

```@example soilmodel
arch = CPU()
grid = ColumnGrid(arch, Float32, ExponentialSpacing(N = 10)) # 10 soil layers
model = SoilModel(grid)
integrator = initialize(model, ForwardEuler(eltype(grid)))
```

```@docs; canonical = false
SoilModel
```

### Components

The default representation of coupled soil physics is [`SoilEnergyWaterCarbon`](@ref), which consists of four sub-components: All four can be replaced independently when constructing a `SoilModel`; see each linked process page for available implementations and parameterizations.

```@docs; canonical = false
SoilEnergyWaterCarbon
```

| Field | Type | Process page |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `strat` | [`AbstractStratigraphy`](@ref) | [Soil stratigraphy](@ref) |
| `energy` | [`AbstractSoilEnergyBalance`](@ref) | [Soil energy balance](@ref) |
| `hydrology` | [`AbstractSoilHydrology`](@ref) | [Soil hydrology](@ref) |
| `biogeochem` | [`AbstractSoilBiogeochemistry`](@ref) | — |

Each component is summarized briefly below. Follow the linked process pages for full theoretical background, available concrete types, state variables, and method signatures.

#### Stratigraphy

The `strat` component parameterizes the vertical distribution of soil material properties (texture, porosity, organic content). It provides kernel functions used by the energy and hydrology sub-processes to look up spatially varying material properties at each grid cell. By default [`HomogeneousStratigraphy`](@ref) is used, which assumes a single uniform material throughout the profile. See [Soil stratigraphy](@ref) for details.

#### Energy balance

The `energy` component represents heat conduction in the soil column, including the latent heat of freeze-thaw phase change. The default implementation is [`SoilEnergyBalance`](@ref), which evolves the volumetric internal energy $U$ (J m⁻³) as the prognostic variable and derives temperature via the [`SoilEnergyTemperatureClosure`](@ref). See [Soil energy balance](@ref) for details.

#### Hydrology

The `hydrology` component governs the vertical movement of water in the soil column. The default implementation is [`SoilHydrology`](@ref), which evolves total saturation (liquid + ice) as the prognostic variable. Vertical flow is disabled by default ([`NoFlow`](@ref)); enabling the Richards equation requires selecting [`RichardsEq`](@ref) as the `vertflow` operator. See [Soil hydrology](@ref) for details.

#### Biogeochemistry

The `biogeochem` component simulates the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon and associated biogeochemical fluxes. The default implementation [`ConstantSoilCarbonDensity`](@ref) which prescribes a spatially homogeneous organic carbon density and does not define any prognostic variables.

## [Initializers](@id soil.init)

Terrarium provides a hierarchy of initializers for `SoilModel`. The top-level initializer is [`SoilInitializer`](@ref), which composes separate sub-initializers for energy, hydrology, and biogeochemistry. It is the recommended initializer for most use cases:

```@docs; canonical = false
SoilInitializer
```

Passing a `SoilInitializer` to `SoilModel` overrides the `DefaultInitializer`:

```@example soilmodel
initializer = SoilInitializer(Float32;
    energy    = QuasiThermalSteadyState(Float32; T₀ = 2.0f0),
    hydrology = SaturationWaterTable(Float32; water_table_depth = 3.0f0),
)
model = SoilModel(grid; initializer)
```

### Energy initializers

```@docs; canonical = false
ConstantSoilTemperature
```

```@docs; canonical = false
QuasiThermalSteadyState
```

```@docs; canonical = false
PiecewiseLinearInitialSoilTemperature
```

### Hydrology initializers

```@docs; canonical = false
SaturationWaterTable
```

### Fallback

```@docs; canonical = false
DefaultInitializer
```

## Boundary conditions

Terrarium provides a set of named boundary condition aliases for the most common `SoilModel` configurations. These return `NamedTuple`s in the format expected by the `boundary_conditions` keyword argument of [`initialize`](@ref).

### Energy boundary conditions

GroundHeatFlux
```

```@docs; canonical = false
GeothermalHeatFlux
```

```@docs; canonical = false

```

```@docs; canonical = false

```

### Hydrology boundary conditions
