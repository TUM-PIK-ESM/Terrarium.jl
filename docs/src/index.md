# Terra.jl

Terra.jl is a new and upcoming land model that aims to support hybrid physics- and data-driven land modeling across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We envision Terra to be part of a new generation of Earth system component models that combine modularity, interactivity, GPU-compability and auto-differentiability (AD) for seamless integration of process-based and data-driven model components in both global and regional scale simulations.

Terra is being developed alongside [SpeedyWeather.jl](https://github.com/SpeedyWeather/SpeedyWeather.jl) and [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl) as the land component of the proposed DELTA-ESM project which aims to realize this vision by building a new, user-friendly, and fully GPU/AD-compatible Earh System Model in the Julia programming language.

> This is an early prototype of our model and is not production-ready. Expect things to change rapidly and break often. If you share our vision for a new paradigm of Earth system modeling and would like to get involved in the project, don’t hesitate to reach out by creating an issue on GitHub issues or sending us an email. We are always happy to welcome new collaborators!
