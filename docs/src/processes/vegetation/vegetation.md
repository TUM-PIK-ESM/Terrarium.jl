Vegetation processes simulate the biological and biogeochemical dynamics of terrestrial plants, including photosynthesis, phenology, respiration, and carbon cycling. The vegetation module in Terrarium currently consists of the following processes:

- **Photosynthesis** — light-dependent gross primary production (CO₂ uptake)
- **Stomatal conductance** — controls leaf gas exchange in response to light, humidity, and water stress
- **Autotrophic respiration** — plant maintenance and growth respiration
- **Phenology** — seasonal variation in leaf area (LAI) and fractional vegetation coverage
- **Carbon dynamics** — prognostic evolution of vegetation carbon pools (leaves, stems, roots, etc.)
- **Plant-available water** (PAW) — soil moisture stress factor affecting transpiration and photosynthesis
- **Root distribution** (optional) — vertical profile of root density for soil-plant water coupling
- **Vegetation dynamics** (optional) — prognostic plant population density or fractional coverage evolution

These individual processes are composed together in implementations [`AbstractVegetation`](@ref) which provide complete representations of vegetation carbon and population dynamics with which other model components can be coupled.

## Vegetation carbon

The primary implementation of [`AbstractVegetation`](@ref) is [`VegetationCarbonCycle`](@ref), which couples together all of the above processes governing the carbon cycle of natural vegetation. `VegetationCarbonCycle` also provides a coupling interface for interacting with [`AbstractAtmosphere`](@ref) and [`AbstractSoil`](@ref) components.

        constants::PhysicalConstants,

        soil::Optional{AbstractSoil} = nothing,
        args...
    )

compute_tendencies!(state, grid, veg::VegetationCarbonCycle, constants::PhysicalConstants, atmos::AbstractAtmosphere, args...)
```

## Prescribed vegetation

Terrarium also provides [`PrescribedVegetation`](@ref), a lighter-weight [`AbstractVegetation`](@ref) coupling for simulations in which the leaf area index is imposed externally (via [`PrescribedPhenology`](@ref)) rather than evolved from a prognostic carbon pool. It composes phenology, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, root distribution, and plant-available water, together with a set of plant functional-type `traits`, but carries no prognostic vegetation carbon, vegetation-fraction dynamics, or autotrophic respiration. As such, the model defines no tendencies and is driven entirely by the prescribed LAI (`leaf_area_index` input variable) and atmospheric forcing.
