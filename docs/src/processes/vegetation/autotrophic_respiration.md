## Overview

Gross primary production
(GPP) provides the carbon input to the system. A fraction of this carbon is released back to the atmosphere through autotrophic
respiration $R_a$, which is represented as the sum of two terms: maintenance respiration $R_m$ (the carbon cost of
maintaining existing plant tissues) and growth respiration $R_g$ (the carbon cost of producing new plant tissues).


```math
\begin{equation}
R_a = R_m + R_g
\end{equation}
```

The remaining
carbon is the net primary production (NPP), which is then allocated to the different plant components.

```math
\begin{equation}
\text{NPP} = \text{GPP} - R_a
\end{equation}
```

## PALADYN autotrophic respiration model

```@docs; canonical = false
PALADYNAutotrophicRespiration
```

```@example vegresp
using Terrarium
variables(PALADYNAutotrophicRespiration(Float32))
```

This implementation follows the autotrophic respiration scheme of PALADYN (Willeit, 2016).

### Maintenance respiration

Maintenance respiration is computed as the sum of leaf, stem, and root respiration

```math
\begin{equation}
R_m = R_{\text{leaf}} + R_{\text{stem}} + R_{\text{root}}
\end{equation}
```

where $R_{\text{leaf}}$ is the dark respiration computed by the photosynthesis scheme, and $R_{\text{stem}}$ and $R_{\text{root}}$ are each computed from the corresponding tissue carbon pool and their assigned C:N ratios.

### Growth respiration

Growth respiration is taken as a fixed fraction of the carbon available after maintenance respiration

```math
\begin{equation}
R_g = 0.25 \cdot (\text{GPP} - R_m)
\end{equation}
```
