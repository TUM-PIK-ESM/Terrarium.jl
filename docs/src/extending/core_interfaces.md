# Core interfaces

!!! warning "🚧🚧 Under construction 🚧🚧"
    The software architecture of Terrarium.jl is still in an early prototype stage and is the subject of ongoing discussion. This page is a non-exhaustive summary of the current working concept and will be updated accordingly if and when the architecture changes.

## Modularity through multiple dispatch

Terrarium relies heavily on a core feature of Julia: *multiple dispatch*. Multiple dispatch is a programming pattern where methods (functions with a paritcular set of argument types) are dynamically invoked based on the (runtime) types of all their arguments. This can be constrasted to most object-oriented languages (e.g. Java, C/C++/C#, Python, etc.) where dispatch occurs based on only a single (implicit) argument, typically the type of the "object" (or `struct`) with which the method is associated.

Multiple dispatch allows us to implement model components based on specific combinations of types. As a concrete example, consider the following method signature from Terrarium's surface hydrology module that computes the aerodynamic resistance beneath the canopy:
```julia
aerodynamic_resistance(i, j, grid, fields, atmos::AbstractAtmosphere, evtr::PALADYNCanopyEvapotranspiration)
```
This method will be executed when the function `aerodynamic_resistance` is called with any implementation (subtype) of `AbstractAtmosphere` and the `PALADYNCanopyEvapotranspiration` evapotranpsiration scheme. We could define further dispatches that have different implementations for specific subtypes of `AbstractAtmosphere` or alternative canopy evapotranspiration schemes which would then be invoked when the user configures a model with that chocie of components.

In order to maximize code reuse and ease coupling of different components, Terrarium also defines *interfaces* for each model component (such as `AbstractAtmosphere`). These interfaces usually consist of a standard set of methods and behaviors that each component is expected to implement. As an example, `AbstractAtmosphere` defines a method of the form,
```julia
air_temperature(i, j, grid, fields, atmos::AbstractAtmosphere) = fields.air_temperature[i, j]
```
which defaults to assuming that a 2D input `Field` (see [Fields](@ref)) named `air_temperature` has been defined and is available as a property of `fields`. However, alternative implementations could derive this air temperature from other state variables or via some other function, without requiring any changes to the calling code. This kind of interface-based coupling is core to the software design of Terrarium.

### The `AbstractProcess` interface

In the example above, both `AbstractAtmosphere` and `PALADYNCanopyEvapotranspiration` are examples of "processes* that subtype the `AbstractProcess` type.

Implementations of `AbstractProcess` represent physical processes characterized by:
- Zero or more state `variable`s that vary spatially across any given `grid`,
- Zero or more *parameters* that are spatially constant and defined somewhere within the process `struct`,
- One or more functions defining equations that compute quantities of interest from both the state variables and parameters defined by the process.

Concrete implementations of `AbstractProcess` are `struct` types that typically consist of zero or more parameters or parameter `struct`s (also sometimes referred to as *parameterizations*).

Default (no-op) implementations of [`variables`](@ref) and [`initialize!`](@ref) are provided for convenience. However, to avoid ambiguity, `compute_auxiliary!` and `compute_tendencies!` **must be defined by each process** even if they are not needed.

The required additional `args` are may vary for each type of `AbstractProcess`; typically they consist of either other `AbstractProcess`es on which the process depends or universal parameter types like [`PhysicalConstants`](@ref). These argument types must be clearly documented and standardized for each abstract subtype of `AbstractProcess`. Changes to these interfaces, e.g. the addition of alternative call patterns with different `args`, should be made with great care and only when absolutely necessary. It is recommended for implementations to always include trailing `args...` to ensure forward compatibility.

For more details on the `state` structure and definition of `variables`, see the section on [State variables](@ref) below.

#### Coupled processes

Terrarium also defines a base type for *coupled processes*, i.e. processes that define a physical coupling of two or more sub-processes:
```@docs; canonical = false
AbstractCoupledProcesses
```

It is important to note that `AbstractCoupledProcesses` is itself a subtype of `AbstractProcess` and thus subtypes must also implement the same interface for `AbstractProcess`. The main reason to subtype `AbstractCoupledProcesses` instead of `AbstractProcess` is to define a coupling interface for logical groups of processes, e.g. [`SoilEnergyWaterCarbon`](@ref) or [`VegetationCarbon`](@ref). Additionally, concrete implementations may provide specialized computation kernels that *fuse* the respective kernel functions from each of the sub-processes for greater efficiency.

### The `AbstractModel` interface

The main difference between a "model" and a "process" in Terrarium lies in the specification of the `grid` and `initializer`. Processes should be generally be defined independently from any particular choice of initialization, boundary conditions, and `grid`. However, it is worth noting that processes *are* permitted to dispatch on specific types of `grid`, if necessary.

Note that subtypes of `AbstractModel` and `AbstractCoupledProcesses` also automatically inherit a default implementation of the `processes` method:
```@docs; canonical = false
processes(::Union{AbstractModel, AbstractCoupledProcesses})
```

## State variables
State variables are symbolically defined for each process in their respective implementations of the `variables` method by returning instances of [`AbstractVariable`](@ref) which define (at minimum) its name, dimensionality, and physical units. State variables may be one of three types:
```@docs; canonical = false
PrognosticVariable
AuxiliaryVariable
InputVariable
```
which can also be instantiated using one of the convenience methods [`prognostic`](@ref), [`auxiliary`](@ref), or [`input`](@ref).

!!! info Variables vs. `Field`s
	Within the context of defining and handling model/process state, Terrarium distinguishes between *variables* and *Fields*. Variables are symbolic objects subtyping [`AbstractVariable`](@ref) that contain metadata about the state variable defined by the process or model type. These variables are realized as [`Fields`](@ref) defined over the model grid.

As a simple example, suppose we are implementing a new process `MyProcess` and we want to define the necessary state variables. We do this by defining a new dispatch of the `variables` method:
```julia
variables(::MyProcess) = (
	prognostic(:progvar, XYZ()),
	auxiliary(:auxvar, XYZ()),
	auxiliary(:bc, XY()),
	input(:input, XY())
)
```
This will result in a total of five state variables being allocated upon initialization: two auxiliary variables named `auxvar` and `bc` as well as one prognostic variable named `progvar` along with its corresponding tendency variable which is created automatically. The second argument to the variable metadata constructors `prognostic` and `auxiliary` is a subtype of `VarDims` which specifies on which spatial dimensions the state variable should be defined. `XYZ()` corresponds to a 3D `Field` which varies both laterally and with depth.

Currently, Terrarium only supports a single 3D grid representing variables defined in the soil domain, though this may change in the future in order to accommodate multi-layer snow and canopy processes. `XY()` corresponds to a 2D field which is discretized along the lateral dimension only. Note that Terrarium also currently supports only 1D (vertical) dynamics so all grid cells on the X and Y axes will be assumed independent. This is equivalent to what is typically called a *single column* model, or *column-based parameterization* in atmosphere and ocean modeling. However, building on Oceananigans means that we have a clear path to relax this assumption in the future!
