# Reactant-specific stepping runner. Included by the driver only for the `reactant-*` architectures,
# after `using Reactant` — the `@compile` macro must be resolvable when this file is parsed.
#
# `run!` on a `ReactantState` integrator compiles the stepping loop on every call: its `compiled_run!`
# argument lets a caller supply a previously compiled program, but the compiled program is never
# handed back (see `ext/TerrariumReactantExt/integrator.jl`). Timing `run!` would therefore time the
# XLA compiler, not the model. We compile once here — with exactly the flags the extension uses — and
# report the compile time as its own metric, since for Reactant it is a headline number in itself.
