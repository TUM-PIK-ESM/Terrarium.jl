# Model configuration registry for the Terrarium benchmark suite.
#
# A configuration is one `build_model(::Val{:name}, arch, NF; nlat_half, nz, model_kwargs)` method
# returning `(; model, boundary_conditions, initializers, Δt)`. The architecture and the resolution
# (`nlat_half` horizontally, `nz` vertically) are the ONLY things that vary between benchmark runs;
# everything else is fixed by the configuration so that numbers from different architectures and
# resolutions stay comparable.
#
# This mirrors the registry pattern used by `test/reactant/setup.jl`.
#
# Reactant note: closures that end up inside a traced time step (boundary conditions in particular)
# must capture only `isbits` values — a closure over `NF` captures a `Type` and fails to compile.
# Numeric constants are therefore hoisted into local variables before the closure is formed.

both refines the profile and deepens the column.
